## üõ† Prerequisites

‚ö†Ô∏è **UPDATE**: Discord has updated how their servers get requests. Discord only allows requests from their own domains and APIs. In order to use BetterDiscordPanel, you must set a custom User Agent.

Unfortunately, this has to be set every time you open up BetterDiscordPanel. A solution is currently being worked on for this.

### Setting a custom User Agent in Chrome

1. Open Chrome's `developer console`. You can press the Ctrl + Shift + I keys.

2. Click on the icon of the dots in the top right corner.

`BDP (http://example.com), v0.0.1`

6. Start using BetterDiscordPanel!
